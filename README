GST-GNU lightning
=================

A Smalltalk binding of GNU lightning. GNU lightning exposes a 
portable interface for generating machine language at run-time. 
GNU lightning is fast and tries to be as little intrusive as 
possible, so that the generated code can also be optimized 
easily. So far, it has been ported to the x86, SPARC and 
PowerPC architecture.
